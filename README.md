 Interactive Photo Gallery

Treehouse Techdegree project from my course

The task was to use vanilla JavaScript to implement multiple plugins to display photographs.
BaguetteBox.js was used to create lightbox viewer for photos.
Photos could be filtered using pre determined search words using a search plugin, however I opted for a custom one.

created using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
